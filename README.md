# Leetcode Solutions & Progress

Welcome to my **Leetcode solutions repository**! This repository contains my journey of solving problems on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/u/MNRD/) to enhance my problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a different topic or category of Leetcode problems such as:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Dynamic Programming
- Graphs
- Linked Lists
- and more...

Within each folder, you'll find individual files for the problems I've solved, typically named after the problem title or Leetcode problem number.

## Progress Tracking

I actively update this repository as I solve more problems on Leetcode. Hereâ€™s my current status:

- **Total problems solved**: 21
- **Focus areas**: (e.g., Arrays, Graphs, etc.)
- **Languages used**: JavaScript, Python, C++, etc.

## My Approach

For each problem, I provide:

1. **Problem Statement**: A brief description of the problem.
2. **Solution**: My approach to solving it.
3. **Time & Space Complexity**: Analysis of the algorithm's efficiency.

## Contributions & Feedback

If you find any errors in my solutions or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
